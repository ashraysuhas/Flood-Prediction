            Flood forecasting is the use of forecasted precipitation and streamflow data in rainfall-runoff and
            streamflow routing models to forecast flow rates and water levels for periods ranging from a few hours to
            days ahead, depending on the size of the watershed or river basin. Flood forecasting can also make use of
            forecasts of precipitation in an attempt to extend the lead-time available. Flood forecasting is an
            important component of flood warning, where the distinction between the two is that the outcome of flood
            forecasting is a set of forecast time-profiles of channel flows or river levels at various locations, while
            "flood warning" is the task of making use of these forecasts to tell decisions on warnings of floods.
            Real-time flood forecasting at regional area can be done within seconds by using the technology of
            artificial neural network. Effective real-time flood forecasting models could be useful for early warning
            and disaster prevention.
